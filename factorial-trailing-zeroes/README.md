# Factorial Trailing Zeroes

Not sure how this is a coding question exactly, but the idea is that you will have 5s way more than you will have 2s. Basically find the multiplicity for all the power of 2 (this is because 5^2 provides two zeros, 5^1 provides only 1 etc.) [good solution here](https://www.purplemath.com/modules/factzero.htm).
