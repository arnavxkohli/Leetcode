# Split Linked List Into Parts

This question is a bit tricky to do, especially with Python. I think in general C++ might be the best language to do linked list questions because of it's intuitive pointer related stuff. Since pointers are by reference in Python, makes things a little more complicated.

Do this one again soon btw.
