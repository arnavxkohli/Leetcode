# Make Sum Divisible by P

This is a classic prefix sum problem. The trick here is regarding modulo and remainders. Something interesting I found in C++ is that the modulo operator can return negative values. This can be worked around by adding p before taking the modulo.

Finding the previous remaining remainder is the only real tricky bit in this question. Pretty good one to think about.
