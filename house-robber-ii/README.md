# House Robber II

Same as House Robber I, but there are two states. This state way of thinking has come from buying and selling stock questions. The two states are if the first house was robbed or not. The problem is largely the same except at the first index, you find the maximum of the two possibilities from robbing or not robbing the first house, and for the last index, if the first house was robbed you can't rob it.
