# Longest Subarray With Maximum Bitwise AND

This is a solution to the problem of finding the longest subarray with maximum bitwise AND. The problem is to find the length of the longest subarray of a given array such that the bitwise AND of all the elements in the subarray is maximum.

The key insight here is that the bitwise AND of two equal number is the number itself. Since we have to find the maximum bitwise AND, we can find the maximum number in the array and then find the length of the longest subarray that contains only that number.
